** About this Package

*** Purpose

    Interactively cleanup IDs which have been created by org-id but
    are no longer referenced from anywhere else in org.

    Normal usage of org-id does not lead to a lot of unreferenced IDs,
    and org-id normally does not suffer from them.
    However, some packages like org-working-set lead to such IDs during
    normal usage; in such cases it might be helpful clean up.

*** Setup

    org-id-cleanup can be installed with package.el
