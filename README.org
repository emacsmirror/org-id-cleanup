** About this Package

*** Purpose

    Interactively find and clean up unused IDs of org-id.
    The term 'unused' refers to IDs, that have been created by org-id
    regularly, but are now no longer referenced from anywhere within in org.
    This might e.g. happen by deleting a link, that once referenced such an id.

    Normal usage of org-id does not lead to a lot of such unused IDs, and
    org-id does not suffer much from them.

    However, some usage patterns or packages (like org-working-set) may
    produce a larger number of such unused IDs; in such cases it might be
    helpful to clean up with org-id-cleanup.
